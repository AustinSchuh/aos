// however it exits.  There are no names, files or kernel objects to clean up.
//
// One registry per process, keyed by channel name and type, so every
// ProcessLocalQueue for a channel hands back the same block.  The block lives
// until the process exits, not until its last user is destroyed: a listener
// thread that restarts, or a test that builds a new event loop, still finds
// the last message, which is the contract shared memory has inside one
// process too.  Memory is bounded by the number of distinct channels, which
// is what shared memory costs as well.
//
// Neither --shm_base nor --permissions means anything here.
